# Misc folder

This folder contains miscelanious files used while developping the main app. The structure and content of this folder and sub-folders is explained here.

The directory is structured in the following way

```cmd
.
├── Dataset
│   ├── photo
│   │   ├── CPP_code
│   │   │   ├── code_test
│   │   │   └── photo_taker
│   └── video
│       └── video_taker.py
└── Driver
    └── procfs_test
```

- The folder Dataset contains all code used for building the Dataset. It is split in two, one folder containing the code used for the picture dataset, the other for the video dataset.
- The folder Driver contains test of ways to implement the driver for the main app.
